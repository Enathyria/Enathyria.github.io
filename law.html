            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In keeping with the Enathyrian spirit, everything inside of this document is subject to discussion and change. <br>
                Goals of this document are to formalize ideas,
                and provide a detailed, clear, and transparent system of rules regarding the inner workings of Enathyria.<br>
                (Also to be a reference to prevent fights)
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                To avoid any misinterpretation, we will clarify that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each mention of "citizen" refers only to Enathyrian citizens;</li>
                    <li>Each mention of "the nation" refers to Enathyria;</li>

            <h2>Guidelines and Rules</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>1 - Don't be a dick.</h4>
                    <p>I think Aegis said it well: "Don't seek satisfaction from making the game less fun for someone else".</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>2 - Everything is up for discussion. Nothing is set in stone.</h4>
                    <p>If there's something that should probably be changed - then why not change it?
                    Everyone is urged to take any arguments seriously, as unconventional as they may be.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>3 - No desctructive criticism or personal attacks.</h4>
                    <p>If you want things to improve, then tell people about their mistakes in a way that allows them to improve things.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>1 - Don't shame others for making mistakes.</h4>
                    <p>Discussing is learning - and when learning, mistakes will happen.
                    In a community where people are put down for making mistakes, they will be afraid to admit them (Guideline 3).</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>2 - No discrimination or derogatory terms.</h4>
                    <p>Why judge people on things they have no influence on?</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>3 - Don't send malicious links or messages that crash other people's Discord client.</h4>
                    <p>Your funsies will not outweigh the hassle this causes.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>4 - Don't post stuff that is very NSFW (or put it in a spoiler if relevant).</h4>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>5 - Use channels and forum tags for their designated purpose.</h4>
                    <p>Let's not lose track of what we talk about.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>6 - Don't be intrusive about someone's personal life. No doxxing. No leaking DM histories.</h4>
                    <p>You're not the one to choose who other people share their data with.
                    When leaking DM histories without mutual consent, we'll assume there is more context to it, so they don't prove anything except that you suck.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>7 - Avoid spam and spam-pinging.</h4>
                    <p>Why use lot message when few message do trick?</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>8 - Don't knowingly spread misinformation (no matter what the topic).</h4>
                    <p>You're not helping anyone by lying. What you think is a “white” lie might not be one to others.
                    Information you think is irrelevant might not be irrelevant to others. So be honest, even if it means being blunt:
                    If people get mad at you, that's on them.<br>
                    Conversely, there is no need for you to get mad at others for being honest.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>9 - Avoid unnecessary drama: Try to talk to people about issues you may have instead of slandering them behind their backs.</h4>
                    <p>Guideline 3.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>10 - If you have a nice idea for the nation's lore, speak to a lorewriter before declaring it official.</h4>
                    <p>Coordination stuff. It'll probably be fine but in rare cases, it might not match up with plans or the lore we already have.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Citizenship</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Recruitment</h3>
                <p>Any person who is not in poor standing with Enathyria can join the nation on Atlas and will then be granted the "Recruit" role.<br>
                To discourage a large coherent group of players from joining the nation with the intent of sabotaging it by voting,
                recruits do not have voting rights. <br>
                By default, after 1 week in Enathyria and at least 10 hours of active playtime in the nation,
                a recruit will be granted the role of “Citizen” and all the rights that come with it.<br>
                At the discretion of the Council, these requirements can be eliminated completely, or increased up to 3 weeks and 30 hours.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Honorary Citizenship</h3>
                <p>Coming soon! (Yes, it will happen)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inactivity</h3>
                <p>After 3 months of in-game inactivity,
                the nation reserves the right to take all resources (barring lore/sentimental items) belonging to you
                and move them into the communal storage (this is the Council's responsibility).<br>
                Lore / sentimental items may instead be put on display if they are relevant to the nation, or else archived.<br>
                The Council will keep a list of what items have been taken and try their best to give them back in case you ever return.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Lawmaking and Voting</h2>
            <p>
                Reason and discussion are highly valued in Enathyria. It is not the Council, but the citizens who have the final say on decisions.
                While Enathyria is a democracy, citizens ideally should not try to simply outnumber each other,
                but work together to find the best overall solution.
                For this, a general process has been laid out.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>Petition</h4>
                <p>
                    A citizen suggests something. If the Council considers the change trivial,
                    they may pass it as such without the need for a lengthy vote.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Discussion</h4>
                <p>
                    If said suggestion is not trivial, a discussion thread will be created in case the original suggestion is not already in a thread.
                    Citizens can also create a discussion directly if they want to point out a problem, but don't have any immediate solution in mind.
                    During discussion, the Council will also create drafts for a vote, but each citizen can do so too.
                    Citizens are encouraged to react to drafts they support with the thumbsup emoji.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Vote</h4>
                <p>
                    As soon as the Council thinks it's appropriate to do so, the Draft that is liked most will go live on the voting machine.
                    The Council can also decide to include questions from multiple drafts in case there is a question that is not contained in the top draft,
                    but it has to always include all questions from the most popular draft.
                    Questions may ask you to rate multiple alternatives (the most popular of which will then become law),
                    or they may be conditional (if we …, then should we …?), depending on the vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that nothing is final.
                    For any decision or law that can be changed, any citizen can demand a re-discussion
                    if they think they have a better idea on how to handle things.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Voting</h3>
                <p>
                    Enathyria uses a form of score voting, allowing voters to rate options and answer questions on a scale of one through seven
                    with one representing the lowest score, seven the highest, and four being a neutral opinion.<br>
                    Voting is strongly encouraged but not required.<br>
                    People can also abstain from rating an option if they feel they don't have enough information.
                    Each vote might consist of multiple questions / options.<br>
                    Votes will be made available for at least three days, either in game or on the nation's discord,
                    allowing citizens time to fully understand and discuss the options put forth.
                    If the vote is edited for any reason while active, the three day requirement begins from the time of the last edit.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Voting Machine</h4>
                    <p>
                        In game, multiple voting machines will be built that will allow citizens to vote fully anonymously (assuming no player is hacking).
                        Each machine has 6 slots, meaning it can run 6 questions at a time.
                        To vote, you have to input a key that is unique to you, such as a signed book.<br>
                        If necessary, Discord votes will be used as a fallback method.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Council</h2>
            <p>
                The Council is a group of up to 5 individuals, elected by the citizens. Its responsibilities include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Accelerating the law-making process by passing laws it considers trivial without a lengthy vote,</li>
                    <li>Taking emergency decisions that leave no time to vote,</li>
                    <li>Taking decisions that need to be kept secret from outsiders,</li>
                    <li>Prioritizing votes,</li>
                    <li>Creating votes with fairly represented options so citizens can make informed decisions,</li>
                    <li>Deliberating on issues that might arise in the future,</li>
                    <li>Granting roles, such as moderator, judge, diplomat, etc,</li>
                    <li>Discussing and enacting punishments,</li>
                    <li>Any other activities necessary for the function of the nation not otherwise laid out.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Council must report each law made and each rule changed in an announcement channel that is visible to all citizens.
                It must give reasons for any decision it takes.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Council Elections</h3>
                <p>
                    The Council can be re-elected at any time.
                    This is triggered by a unique petition that requires 20% of citizens to agree to come into effect,
                    otherwise the re-election petition closes after 7 days.
                    Existing Council members continue to hold their seats until a new council is elected, but can leave the Council whenever they want.<br>
                    The Council election will consist of two phases, a nomination phase and a voting phase.
                    Starting the day after the re-election petition comes into effect the nomination phase will begin.
                    In this phase citizens will nominate themselves as candidates for the position of Council member.
                    After three days the voting phase will begin where each candidate will be rated by the citizens.
                    After four days of voting or when all citizens have voted,
                    the five candidates with the highest average ranking above neutral will become the new Council.
                    In the case that less than five candidates qualify, then there will be a smaller or empty council until another election occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not want a Council at all, you should suggest this in a separate suggestion instead of rating all candidates the minimum rating.
                    That way you can still give your honest opinion on all of the candidates in the event that a Council will happen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Good Council Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                    All Council members hold the power to quickly make decisions by themselves only in case of an emergency,
                    postponing (but never abandoning!) discussion, which is called a "Swift Action".
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reasonably quickly pass laws that are probably trivial, but not an emergency,
                    any Council member can suggest a law they consider trivial to the Council and ask for approval by all other Council members.
                    The law can be passed once all Council members have approved of it, or if after 24 hours no Council member has disapproved.
                    If any Council member disapproves, the law is probably not trivial and should be discussed publicly, and eventually voted on.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Diplomacy</h2>
            <p>
                This will be done once Enathyria has more citizens. The basic idea, however, is to assign one or multiple nations to each diplomat.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Pactmaking</h3>
                <p>
                    Major diplomatic acts, such as allying or proposing cooperation pacts, need to be ratified by the nation at large.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Moderation</h2>
            <p>
                The role of Moderator is granted by the Council.<br>
                All Council members also have moderation permissions, even if they are not a moderator, to take swift action if necessary.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Swift Action</h3>
                <p>
                    A swift action is an executive action whose discussion is postponed due to urgency.
                    Any Council member or moderator can take swift action if necessary,
                    such as banishing trolls, muting people or fixing broken permissions.
                    Anyone who takes swift action has to report their action to the Council.
                    If the Council considers a moderator's action unjustified, they can revoke the decision
                    and, in extreme cases, take away moderating rights from that person (after considering the Main principle of punishment).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Punishment</h3>
                <p>
                    Punishment will be distributed by the Council
                    when a citizen or group of citizens violate the laws of the nation or otherwise harm the nation or its members.
                    When a swift action is necessary an appointed moderator may apply limited punishments
                    to be ratified by the council at a later time.<br>
                    Punishment can involve being muted, paying fines in the form of treasure, labor, or other property of value
                    to be paid to either the aggrieved party or the nation,
                    and in cases of irreconcilable differences the punishment may instead be banishment.
                    An individual who is banished is to be removed from any areas controlled by the nation
                    until such a time as their banishment is reconsidered.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Main Principle of Punishment</h4>
                    <p>
                        Never should anyone be punished for doing something with good intentions
                        and sufficient reason to assume that what they did was necessary,
                        even if it later turns out not to be.
                    </p>
